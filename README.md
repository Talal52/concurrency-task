# fileToArray: 
The given code is a Go program that reads a file named "text.txt" and calculates the sum of all the integer values present in that file. Here is the step-by-step description of the code:

1. The program starts by importing required packages - "fmt" for printing output, "log" for logging errors, "os" for file operations, "strconv" for string to integer conversion and "strings" for string manipulation.

2. The main function is defined which reads the contents of "text.txt" file using the `os.ReadFile` function which returns a byte slice and an error. If an error occurs while reading the file, the program logs the error using the `log.Fatal` function and terminates.

3. The byte slice returned by `os.ReadFile` is converted to a string using the `string` function and then split into an array of string values using the 
```
strings.Fields
```
function which splits the string using white spaces as the delimiter. The resulting array contains all the words present in the file.

4. The `append` function is called to append a nil value to the array. This is done to avoid an index out of range error in case the file contains no data.

5. The variable `sum` is initialized to zero.

6. The program uses a `for...range` loop to iterate through all the elements of the array. Inside the loop, each string element is converted to an integer using the
```
strconv.Atoi
```
function. If an error occurs while converting the string to an integer, the program logs the error using
```
log.Fatal
```
function and terminates.

7. The converted integer value is added to the `sum` variable.

8. Finally, the program prints the sum of all the integer values present in the file using the "fmt.Println" function.


# gochannels.go:
The above code is a Go program that performs the following operations:

1. Reads a text file named `text.txt`, which contains space-separated integers, and stores the integers in an array.

2. Divides the array into equal-sized chunks, and spawns a specified number of goroutines (concurrent execution units in Go) to calculate the sum of each chunk concurrently.

3. Collects the results of each goroutine through a channel, and calculates the final sum of the entire array.

4. Parses command-line arguments using the `flag` package. The program expects a file path to be provided using the `-file` flag, and a string value to be provided using the `-svar` flag.

5. Reads the contents of the file whose path is provided as a command-line argument, and prints the contents to the standard output. If the file path is not provided, the program terminates with an error message.

6. The program prints the sum of each chunk and the final sum of the array to the standard output.

# channel.go:
This is a Go program that reads data from a file named `text.txt` and calculates the sum of all the numbers in the file using concurrent programming with goroutines.

The program first reads the content of the file using the `os.ReadFile()` function and stores it as a string. It then splits the string into an array of strings using the `strings.Fields()` function.

The program then divides the array into multiple chunks based on the value of the routines variable, which is set to 5 in this case. Each chunk is then processed concurrently using a separate goroutine created by the go keyword.

The `addition()` function takes an array of strings, a number of chunks, a start index, an end index, and a channel as its parameters. It converts each string in the specified chunk into an integer using the `strconv.Atoi()` function and adds it to a sum. The sum is then sent to the channel.

After all the chunks are processed, the program receives the sum of each chunk from the channel and calculates the final sum by adding them together. Finally, it prints the sum of the array to the console.
## version:
As for the version of Go that supports this code, the `os.ReadFile()` function was introduced in Go `version 1.16`, which was released in February 2021. So, any version of Go that is 1.16 or later should support this code.
